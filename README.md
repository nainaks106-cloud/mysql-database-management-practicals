📚 Online Bookstore Management System



🗄️ 100 Advanced MySQL DDL Practice Questions



📌 ***Project Overview***

This project is a real-world database design practice for an Online Bookstore Management System built using MySQL (DDL – Data Definition Language).

The goal of this project is to design, modify, manage, and restructure a complete relational database schema that handles:

📖 Books

✍️ Authors

🏷️ Categories

👤 Customers

🛒 Orders

💳 Payments

🚚 Delivery Agents

⭐ Reviews

🎟️ Coupons

🔁 Return Requests

❤️ Wishlists

This repository contains 100 structured DDL practice questions covering beginner to advanced database concepts.
